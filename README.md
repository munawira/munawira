Hi! I am Munawira Kotyad.

I am currently pursuing my Phd in Computer Science from [IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/). My research interests lie in GPGPU Architecture and Performance, Microarchitecture Performance and OS-Microarch Interactioins. I am primarily conducting research in the area GPU microarchitecture enhancements to accelerate non traditional, scientific and AI GPGPU workloads. The research involves designing novel out of order scheduling techniques and front end pipeline redesign to extract Instruction Level Parallelism from applications with limited data level parallelism.

I have a Master's  of Science Degree from North Carolina State University, Raleigh. Most of my courses and projects were focused on Microarchitecture, Operating Systems and Parallel computing. 

After graduating, I started working as a Core OS developer at Intel Corporation in Oregon. I worked on OS optimization of Windows operating systems across Intel architecture. My work required writing kernel drivers to implement various power saving features for Windows OS. 

I will be using this space to update my projects and research progress during my PhD Journey.
